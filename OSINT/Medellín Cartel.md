# Question :
Assume that you are working for Law Enforcement, do you really got some IQ to investigate high profile criminals?

# Hint that was given :
**1.** The Sicariosâ€¦

**2.** You might think the given picture, is useless. Guessy. But its not. If u are about to investigate a crime group. You have to criminal-profile every single member of the group. E.g what they do, eat, visit, etc. If u recon, Blacky AKA Nelson Hernandez is the only sicarios that has went to uniten IG. U should focus on that acc only. For real - If u went to other sicarios, u will get lost. Next step? Technical stuff. Dig the flag inside the IG, metadata is there. That is how u profile someone, dig deeper as u could on that acc.

# The Flag :
***RWSC{Bl4cky_S1c4r1o}***
